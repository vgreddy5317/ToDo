# ToDo
A To-Do List is a task management tool that helps users organize, prioritize, and track their daily activities. It allows users to add tasks, set deadlines, categorize them, mark them as completed, and filter or sort based on priority and due date. This helps improve productivity by keeping track of pending and completed tasks efficiently.
